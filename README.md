Calorify is a Python-based machine learning project that detects food items from images and provides calorie estimates using deep learning. It aims to help users make informed dietary choices by combining computer vision with nutritional data.

**Features**
- Real-time image recognition of food items
- Calorie estimation using a trained deep learning model
- Web interface for easy image upload and viewing results
- Backend built using Flask
- Supports multiple food classes with associated calorie values

**How It Works**
Users can upload a food image through the web interface. The backend uses a trained Mask R-CNN (or similar object detection model) to identify food items in the image. Based on the detected items, the system calculates approximate calories using a predefined food-to-calorie mapping and displays the result to the user.

**Tech Stack**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS (or EJS)
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- ML Model: TensorFlow/Keras (Mask R-CNN)
- Image Processing: OpenCV
- Deployment: Localhost (can be extended to cloud)

**How to Run**
1. Install dependencies: \`pip install -r requirements.txt\`
2. Start the server: \`python flashserver.py\`
3. Open the frontend: \`npm start\` or open HTML page (if static)

**Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Numpy

This project demonstrates how AI can assist in dietary tracking and promote health-conscious decision-making through automation.
